Hi, I'm Anthony! I'm a digital autodidact ðŸ‘‹

ABOUT ME
I'm a Marine Corps veteran with an IT system administrator background. I developed my skills by working in various tech roles ranging from helpdesk technician to network administrator. During my enlistment, I led and trained small teams of junior technicians. I developed a unique blend of technological, investigative and leadership skills that I bring over to my civilian career.


AN AUTODIDACTIC KNOWLEDGE WORKER
What sets me apart is the eclectic mix of skills and experiences I bring to every organization I choose to work for. I like to introduce myself as a "digital autodidact" because I'm insatiably curious â€” I'm driven to teach myself useful new skills for fun!

Call me a programmer, an artist or a storyteller â€” all three apply! My unique talent stack means I'm positioned to bring a holistic approach to solving your problems. Whether programming the frontend of a mobile app, painting a person's portrait, or teaching a workshop, I'm always looking to challenge myself to grow as a human being. Indulging my curiosity is why I do things.


ON A QUEST
Currently, I'm on a quest to become a threat intelligence researcher who specializes in doing digital forensics in cloud environments! 

I aspire to apply my technical and analytical skills to help identify and investigate cybersecurity intrusions for Fortune 500 companies. I help train others to do the same too. To that end, I'm attending the SANS Technology Institute while working part-time as an IT instructor and tutor.


IF YOU'RE GOING MY WAY, LET'S WALK TOGETHER
Ultimately, my dream is to be widely known as a Renaissance Man of the 21st century! I intend to spend the rest of my life taking risks, learning from my mistakes, and building projects related to the skills that fascinate my curiosity.

If you share a similar dream as mine or just share a mutual interest in art or tech, hit that connect button on my profile and let's talk! 

An easy conversation starter with me is "What have you been learning about lately?" I love answering that question :)
