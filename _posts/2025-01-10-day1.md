## **Today's Progress**: 
I started my #100DaysOfCode challenge today. Here's what I did:
- Posted on Twitter to publicly commit myself to the challenge
- Started working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. Completed [INSERT NUMBER] exercises

## **Thoughts & Feelings**: 
I feel frightened at the start. I think I will keep going, though!

## **Post-Practice Review**:

1. What concepts did you learn from your practice session today?
2. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?
3. Are there any concepts you feel unsure about? Is there anything you want to research or do more drills on?
4. Did you use any tutorial resources outside of FreeCodeCamp?
