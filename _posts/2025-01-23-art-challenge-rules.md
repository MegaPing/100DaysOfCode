In this post, I intend to describe the details associated with my #100DaysOfDrawing challenge!





# Public Commitment
**I, Anthony Avelar, commit myself to completing the #100DaysOfDrawing Challenge by promising to sketch for at least a 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days!**


## My Rules for the Challenge
1. I will code for at least 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days
2. I will tweet an update about my progress every day on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/autodidactdiary/) account
3. I will write a new log entry every day to provide an update on the day's progress
4. I will push a commit to my #100DaysOfDrawing GitHub repo every day (and I'll include a link to that commit in my log entry)
5. I will encourage two other people doing the same challenge on Twitter every day


## General Practice Plan
My intent is to work through work through FreeCodeCamp's curriculum courses:
- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures
- Frontend Development Libraries
- Relational Databases
- Backend Development and APIs



### Practice Routine
Every day, when I sit down to draw, this is the plan I intend to follow:
- Create a new log entry and set an intention for the session (5 min)
- 20 minuteÂ [gesture drawing video](https://www.youtube.com/@GESDRAWPARTY)
- 5 minute break
- 20 minute working on a page from the Cognitive Drawing workbook
- 15 minute post-practice review



### Post-Practice Review Questions

1. What was your main goal for this session? Did you achieve it?
2. What do you like and dislike about your sketches today?
3. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?
4. What did you learn from your practice session today? Is there anything you want to do more drills on?
5. Did you use any tutorial resources apart from the Cognitive Drawing workbook or the GES DRAW PARTY channel?





## The Ultimate Goal
Build [anthonyavelar.com](https://anthonyavelar.com/) into a portfolio website that has a cool 8-bit RPG videogame aesthetic!

Design the website so that it has these features:
- a splash page with a cool animated message to welcome visitors
- a code projects section
- an art gallery
- a blog section
- a contact form





## Ideas for Chronicling The Challenge Better

- Record yourself while coding with ScreenRec

If you record yourself, you can upload a short clip to Twitter! Just keep in mind, you can only upload a 140 second clip, and it can only be 512MB max!


- Add interesting photos, screenshots and gifs

Make it an entertaining and enjoyable experience for anyone who checks your log. Most challenges logs are text heavy and wordy. Make yours different by breaking up the text with images that show what you're working on. Add screenshots of things such as your actual code, a work in progress, a finished site, and even memes to drive home points. 


- Create an introduction

Make a short and sweet introduction of who you are and what your log. Doing this will help the viewer connect with you as a person!


- Include links to live demos

You can use CodePen to create live demos. Take the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code you create and create a new pen to display your work. Then copy the share link of your pen and include it in your log!


- Create and pin a tweet that contains a link to your challenge log

That way, anyone who sees your Twitter page will immediately have a link to your coding journey.
