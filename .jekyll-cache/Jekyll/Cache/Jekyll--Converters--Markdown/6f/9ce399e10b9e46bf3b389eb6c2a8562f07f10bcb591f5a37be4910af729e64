I"<p>Here you can have a quick introduction to the different categories available on the site. Keep in mind that everything is a post, but depending on the category that you chose, you will be able to add more configuration to the post <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">front matter</a>.</p>

<p><em>*Note:* The categories should be in lowercase otherwise things might not work as expected.</em></p>

<h1 id="the-log-category">The Log category</h1>

<p>Any post with this category will be shown in the <em>timeline</em> page, it will show two main topics <em>progress</em> and <em>thoughts</em>. This is basically like the original <em>log.md</em> file that’s suggested on the <a href="http://100daysofcode.com">#100daysofcode</a> page.</p>

<p>You will write everything in the Front Matter, but if you need to write more things or if you just want to expand on your progress/thoughts or just keep notes you can write them as if a normal blog post.</p>

<p>When people press the button <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt; read more</code> the log will open and show the whole post.</p>

<p>## Front Matter configuration</p>

<p><em>*Note:* If you want to add a log to the blog you can add both, simply change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">categories: log</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">categories: log blog</code>.</em></p>

<h1 id="the-projects-category">The Projects category</h1>

<p>When working on the challenge, I started creating a few little projects, but after doing the challenge for 80 days, it became hard to keep track of my projects since I was adding them as folders.</p>

<p>This category is meant for you to keep tabs on what you have worked and how is a specific project going. Basically, you can keep a log of each individual project and when you finish it you can proudly show what you have done and how.</p>

<h2 id="front-matter">Front Matter</h2>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>

<h1 id="the-book-category">The Book category</h1>

<p>My day to day job is based on shift work, which means that sometimes I can’t spend a whole hour coding because my brain is mush due to tiredness.</p>

<p>On days like this, I would spend at least an hour reading a technical book or a blog post.</p>

<p>With this category, I want to give you the power to show off all the books that you have either started or finished off and hopefully, you will feel motivated to read more.</p>

<p>Currently, this category is quite simple, it will show an image of the book is provided, the name and the percentage read. You can use <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">goodreads</a> if you want to know exactly how much you have read.</p>

<h2 id="front-matter-1">Front Matter</h2>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>

<span class="na">image</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="c1"># the image of the book</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="the-blog-category">The Blog category</h1>

<p>The blog category is meant to be anything else that doesn’t fit on any of the other categories. Any post containing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog</code> category will appear on the blog page.</p>

<h2 id="front-matter-2">Front Matter</h2>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> When you open a blog post to read, only the last category will be shown in the post header. Make sure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog</code> is the first category and add whatever else you want after.</em></p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next steps</h1>
