I"‚<p>Hello curious internet visitor, welcome to my blog! My name is Anthony, and Iâ€™m a digital autodidact!</p>

<p>In this introduction post, youâ€™ll learn more about who I am, what I like to do, and why I do it. In doing so, I hope what you read resonates with you, so that one day we might collaborate and maybe even become friends!</p>

<p>I started this blog to commit myself to completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge! Iâ€™ll be chronicling my daily efforts and struggles here!</p>

<h1 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m a guy that likes to introduce himself as <strong>â€œthe Digital Autodidactâ€</strong>! Why is that, you ask? Because I have an insatiable curiosity! I like to teach myself new skills for fun, and make stories about it online. Whatâ€™s the point of living, if not to be curious about the world and maybe learn something useful before our time on earth is up? Letâ€™s learn something together today ğŸ˜„</p>

<p>Ultimately, my dream is to be <strong>a Renaissance Man of the 21st century</strong>! I intend to spend the rest of my life taking risks, learning from my mistakes, and building projects related to the subjects that fascinate my curiosity.</p>

<p>If you share a similar dream as mine or just share a mutual interest, read on!</p>

<p>This blog is where Iâ€™ll chronicle my quest to become a better programmer by completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.</p>

<p>Autodidactism is the practice of self-education. If you like etymology, the name has two parts: â€œautoâ€, meaning self, and â€œdidacticâ€, which relates to teaching or instruction.</p>

<p>Put simply, autodidactism is when you learn a subject or skill independently, usually outside of formal learning institutions (such as K-12 education, or university). The key thing is not whether or not you learn in a classroom, but rather having the â€œautodidact mindsetâ€. If you have the autodidactic mindset, you donâ€™t limit your learning to inside a classroom nor do you cling to one teacher. Youâ€™re a self-directing learner: You take the initiative, setting your own curriculum, your own learning goals and organizing your deliberate practice periods.</p>

<p>You put in plenty of hours studying alone, expanding your knowledge and skills beyond any structured curriculum offered at a university. You keep going for months and years, not for the sake of a credential, but because youâ€™re insatiably curious. Like me ğŸ˜‰</p>

  <p>â€œKnowledge applied is power; happiness is the feeling of power increasingâ€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I aspire to be an individual who has the optimism, competency and confidence to actively shape the world â€” a playful creator, so to speak. I wish to shape the world as I envision it instead of passively letting the world shape me.</p>

<p>Learning how to code is merely one aspect of my commitmment to learning useful skills</p>

<p>The antidote to feelings of powerlessness is to increase the amount of skills at our disposal. As we increase the amount of skills we have, we increase our power to have an effect on the world. And that potency feels good. Really good.</p>

  <p>â€œI wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife; to preach that highest form of success which comes, not to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to the man who does not shrink from danger, from hardship, or from bitter toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph.â€</p>
