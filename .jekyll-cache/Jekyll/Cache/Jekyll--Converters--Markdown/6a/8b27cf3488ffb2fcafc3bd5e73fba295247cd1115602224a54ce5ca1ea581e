I"„<p>This project is meant to be used with the <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge. The challenge is pretty simple, spend at least 1 hour doing something related with code. It doesnâ€™t matter what, reading about code, writing code, helping in an open source project, raising issues, fixing issues, doing exercises, studying, whatever you can think of.</p>
