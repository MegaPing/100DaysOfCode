I"<p>Hello curious internet visitor, welcome to my blog! My name is Anthony, and I’m a digital autodidact!</p>

<p>In this introduction post, you’ll learn more about who I am, what I like to do, and why I do it.</p>

<h1 id="bluf-statement">BLUF Statement</h1>
<p>I started this blog to commit myself to completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge! I’ll be chronicling my daily efforts and struggles here!</p>

<h1 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h1>

<p>I’m a guy that likes to introduce himself as <strong>“the Digital Autodidact”</strong>! Why is that, you ask? Because I have an insatiable curiosity! I like to teach myself new skills for fun, and make stories about it online. What’s the point of living, if not to be curious about the world and maybe learn something useful before our time on earth is up? Let’s learn something together today 😄</p>

<p>Ultimately, my dream is to be <strong>a Renaissance Man of the 21st century</strong>! I intend to spend the rest of my life taking risks, learning from my mistakes, and building projects related to the subjects that fascinate my curiosity.</p>

<p>If you share a similar dream as mine or just share a mutual interest, read on!</p>

<p>This blog is where I’ll chronicle my quest to become a better programmer by completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To promote  autodidactism</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The mind is a beautiful thing to invest in”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Autodidactism is the practice of self-education. Put more simply, autodidactism is when you learn a subject or skill independently, usually outside of formal learning institutions (such as K-12 education, or university). The key thing is not whether or not you learn in a classroom, but rather having the “autodidact mindset”. If you have the autodidactic mindset, you don’t limit your learning to inside a classroom nor do you cling to one teacher. You’re a self-directing learner: You take the initiative, setting your own curriculum, your own learning goals and organizing your practice periods.</p>

<p>You put in plenty of hours studying alone, expanding your knowledge and skills beyond the structured curriculum. You keep going for months and years, not for the sake of a credential, but because you’re insatiably curious.</p>

<p>If you like etymology, the name has two parts: “auto”, meaning self, and “didactic”, which relates to teaching or instruction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To skill up as a playful creator</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Knowledge applied is power; happiness is the feeling of power increasing”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>To promote myself as the digital autodidact</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I shall note be satisfied that I have done my best until my name is known from one end of the world to the other”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>To promote the Strenous Life</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife; to preach that highest form of success which comes, not to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to the man who does not shrink from danger, from hardship, or from bitter toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph.”</p>
