<p>Hello curious internet visitor, welcome to my blog! My name is Anthony, and I’m a digital autodidact!</p>

<p>In this introduction post, you’ll learn more about who I am, what I like to do, and why I do it.</p>

<h1 id="bluf-statement">BLUF Statement</h1>
<p>I started this blog to commit myself to completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I’ll be chronicling my daily efforts and struggles here!</p>

<h1 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h1>

<p>I’m a guy that likes to introduce himself as <strong>“the Digital Autodidact”</strong>! Why is that, you ask? Because I have an insatiable curiosity! I like to teach myself new skills for fun, and make stories about it online. What’s the point of living, if not to be curious about the world and maybe learn something useful before our time on earth is up? Let’s learn something together today 😄</p>

<p>Ultimately, my dream is to be <strong>a Renaissance Man of the 21st century</strong>! I intend to spend the rest of my life taking risks, learning from my mistakes, and building projects related to the subjects that fascinate my curiosity.</p>

<p>If you share a similar dream as mine or just share a mutual interest, read on!</p>

<p>I’m a [noun] doing [verb]!</p>

<p>This blog is where I’ll chronicle my quest to become a better programmer by completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.</p>
