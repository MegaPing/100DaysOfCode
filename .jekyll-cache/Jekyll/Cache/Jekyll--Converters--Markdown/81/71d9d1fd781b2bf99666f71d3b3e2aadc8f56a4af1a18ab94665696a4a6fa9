<p>This is a template for a new log entry.</p>

<p>Use it</p>

<p>Since this is just a normal Jekyll post you can add to what you have written in <strong>progress</strong> and <strong>thoughts</strong>. The reason why you might want this, is because you might be working on something hard and you want to keep track of more things that a two line sentence doesnâ€™t allow for.</p>

<p>The good thing about this, is that you can use it as a simple way to take notes about what you have worked on or learned.</p>
